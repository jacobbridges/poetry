# Poetry Collection API

> **Beautiful words from humans, for humans.**

## Project Journey

I started this project back in 2015 -- then it was just a single Python spider and a dump of poems from poetryfoundation.org. (You can still find the original code on the `legacy` branch if you are interested.)

But now the year is 2025. **The world has changed. And I feel we need poetry now more than ever before.**

## The Plan

My mission is to create an open and refined poetry dataset:

1. **Automated Collection**
   - Design a system to continuously scour the web for poetry
   - Extract poems with full metadata
   - Append findings to Avro files
   - Prioritize poems from established authors

2. **Community Collaboration**
   - Setup a bot to manually ingest poems submitted via Github issues
   - Create a publicly available poetry store
   - Develop a public API for the collection

3. **Developer Resources**
   - Build Jupyter Notebooks to jumpstart developer exploration
   - Publish a Python module for easy dataset interaction

## A Note on AI

**LLM generated poems are not allowed in this dataset.**

While AI can generate poems, this project celebrates human creativity. My reasons for excluding AI-generated content:

- **Soulful Expression**: My favorite part of poetry is catching a glimpse of the author's soul in their words.
- **Data Management**: Preventing endless AI-generated content from overwhelming our public dataset.
